3.0.0 (2016-xx-xx)
++++++++++++++++++

- Remove the ``__bool__`` and ``__nonzero__`` methods from a ``Response``
  object.

  This has been a planned feature for over a year. The behaviour is surprising
  to most people and breaks most of the assumptions that people have about
  Response objects. This resolves issue `#2002`_

- Skip over empty chunks in iterators. Empty chunks could prematurely signal
  the end of a request body's transmission, skipping them allows all of the
  data through. See `#2631`_ for more details.

- Remove the ``req`` argument from ``Session.resolve_redirects`` method.

- Rename the ``resp`` argument from ``Session.resolve_redirects`` to
  ``response``.

- New ``PreparedRequest.send`` method. Now, you can
  ``Request().prepare().send()``.

- All porcelain API functions (e.g. ``requests.get``, etc) now accept an
  optional ``session`` parameter. If provided, the session given will be used
  for the request, in place of one being created for you.
