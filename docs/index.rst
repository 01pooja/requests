Requests: HTTP for Humans
=========================

Release |version|.

Requests is an :ref:`ISC Licensed <isc>` HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely verbose
and cumbersome. Python's builtin :py:class:`urllib2` module provides all the
HTTP capabilities required, but the api is thoroughly **broken**. It reqires an
*enormous* amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of
tasks.

Things shouldnâ€™t be this way. Not in Python.

Enter Requests. Requests allow you to send **GET**, **HEAD**, **PUT**,
**POST**, and **DELETE** HTTP requests. You can add headers, form data,
multipart files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the
response data in the same way. It's powered by :py:class:`urllib2`, but it does
all the hard work and crazy hacks for you.


It's Simple
-----------

::

    >>> import requests
    >>> r = requests.get('https://convore.com/api', auth=('username', 'password'))
    >>> r.headers['content-encoding']
    json

See `the same code, without Requests <http://gist.github.com/some-gist>`_.


Testimonals
~~~~~~~~~~~

`Twitter, Inc <http://twitter.com>`_ and `The Library of Congress <http://www.loc.gov/>`_ use Requests internally.

**Daniel Greenfeld**
    Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to @kennethreitz's request library. Today has been AWESOME.

**Kenny Meyers**
     Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful, simple, Pythonic.
